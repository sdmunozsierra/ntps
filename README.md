* This is just the graphical user interface, no implementation is included.
* There are some samples used in lists and such to show an early idea of how it can be implemented.

* The program uses PyQt5 for the graphical elements.
* To run the GUI, use python to run the NTPS.py file. The other files included are overlays like the "Create/Edit Hook Window". These files must be in the same directory.
* We did not include error overlays as there would be no way to trigger them in this version of the project.
